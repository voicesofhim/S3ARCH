## üîç Critical Discovery: User Identity Mismatch

### The Problem
After analyzing both the Lock Manager and Mock USDA source code, I've identified the exact failure point:

**Lock Manager** (`apps/tim3/ao/lock-manager/src/process.lua:217`):
```lua
ao.send({
    Target = Config.mockUsdaProcess,
    Action = "Lock",
    Tags = {
        User = user,  -- Sends user wallet ID in Tags
        Amount = tostring(amount),
        Locker = ao.id,
        Purpose = purpose,
        LockId = lockId
    }
})
```

**Mock USDA** (`apps/tim3/ao/mock-usda/src/process.lua:217`):
```lua
local user = msg.From  -- Uses sender (Lock Manager) as user!
```

### The Mismatch
- Lock Manager sends `User` in Tags but Mock USDA ignores it
- Mock USDA uses `msg.From` (Lock Manager PID) as the user
- Lock Manager has 0 USDA balance, so lock fails
- Actual user wallet (with 5+ USDA) is never accessed

### Evidence Supporting This Theory
1. Configuration shows successful: `mockUsdaConfigured: true`
2. No "Unauthorized caller" errors occur
3. Lock stays perpetually pending
4. User has sufficient USDA balance (5+ tokens)
5. Lock Manager would have 0 USDA balance

## üéØ Solution: Fix Mock USDA User Identification

The fix is simple - Mock USDA should use the `User` tag from the message, not `msg.From`:

**Current (broken):**
```lua
local user = msg.From  -- Line 217 in mock-usda/src/process.lua
```

**Fixed:**
```lua
local user = msg.Tags.User or msg.From  -- Use User tag if provided
```

## üìã Next Steps

1. Fix the Mock USDA process to properly read the User tag
2. Rebuild and redeploy Mock USDA process
3. Test the mint operation
4. Verify TIM3 balance changes from 0 to 1

## Investigation Timeline

### 09:00 - Initial Analysis
- Read `TIM3_FIRST_PRINCIPLES_INVESTIGATION.md`
- Read `DEAR_CLAUDE_ITS_TIM3_HANDOFF.md`
- Identified three primary hypotheses

### 09:15 - Source Code Review
- Examined Lock Manager implementation (`apps/tim3/ao/lock-manager/src/process.lua`)
- Found Lock Manager sends User in Tags (line 217)
- Examined Mock USDA implementation (`apps/tim3/ao/mock-usda/src/process.lua`)
- **CRITICAL**: Found Mock USDA uses msg.From instead of msg.Tags.User (line 217)

### 09:30 - Root Cause Identified
- Lock Manager correctly sends user wallet ID in Tags.User
- Mock USDA incorrectly uses msg.From (Lock Manager's PID)
- This causes Mock USDA to check Lock Manager's balance (0) instead of user's balance (5+)
- Lock operation fails silently, leaving mint in pending state

## üèÜ Hypothesis Confirmed

**Hypothesis 2 Confirmed**: Missing USDA Lock Handler Implementation
- The Mock USDA handler exists but has incorrect implementation
- It doesn't properly read the User field from the message Tags
- Simple one-line fix will resolve the entire blocking issue

## üîß Fix Implementation

### 09:45 - Solution Applied
Fixed Mock USDA process (`apps/tim3/ao/mock-usda/src/process.lua:217`):

**Before:**
```lua
local user = msg.From  -- Wrong: uses Lock Manager as user
```

**After:**
```lua
local user = msg.Tags.User or msg.From  -- Correct: uses User tag from Lock Manager
```

### Files Created for Testing
1. `apps/tim3/scripts/fix-mock-usda.lua` - Script to update running Mock USDA process
2. `apps/tim3/scripts/test-tim3-mint.lua` - Test script to verify mint operation

### Next Steps
1. Connect to AOS and run the fix script to update the live Mock USDA process
2. Test the mint operation from Wander Wallet
3. Verify TIM3 balance changes from 0 to 1000000000000 (1 TIM3)

## üéØ Ready for Historic First Mint
The fix has been implemented. The Mock USDA process now correctly identifies the user from the Lock Manager's message tags, allowing it to access the actual user's USDA balance for collateral locking.
